####**PROBLEM**
The question : How to escape form tedious administrative tasks of configuration file management?
The answer :  Automate it.
consolidate tailed dotfiles for our taste over year 
The aspects involved in are how to 
 1. distributable to keep your configs synchronized between machines
 2. local customization with some minor differences between installations on multiple machines
 2. cross-platforms + fully backwards-compatible
 3. organized : 
the benefits of symbolically linking files (1) no possibility of accidentally deleting your configuration files. (2) no need to manage discrepancy between copies.
keep your dotfiles under version control using VCS like git, Mercurial (Hg), Bazaar, SVN, even rsync
nmdf =~ vsch + single-repo git (support clone/pull , commit, push for master branch only)
